## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> No content model prompt provided - app built from existing content structure

### Code Generation Prompt

> I want you to create a responsive web application for a salon appointment management system. Requirements: 1. User Data Collection: Store client details: Name, Mobile Number, Email, Service Taken, Date of Last Visit. Option to add/edit/delete client records. 2. Appointment & Notifications: When a new client is added, system should automatically calculate "Next Due Date" (30 days from last visit). Dashboard should show upcoming appointments for the current month. Admin should receive notification/reminder when a client's due date is near. Option to send SMS/WhatsApp/Email reminders to clients. 3. Admin Dashboard: Search & filter clients by name, mobile, or service type. Calendar view of monthly appointments. Export client list in Excel/CSV. 4. Tech Stack: Use React.js (frontend) + Node.js/Express.js (backend). Database: MongoDB (store all client info & appointments). Authentication for admin login (username/password). 5. UI/UX: Clean and modern design with cards and tables. Mobile responsive. Add "Add Client" button + "Upcoming Appointments" section. 6. Extra Features (if possible): Auto reminders via Twilio/WhatsApp API. Appointment history for each client. Deliver a complete working web app code with proper folder structure, APIs, and database schema.

The app has been tailored to work with your existing Cosmic content structure and includes all the features requested above.
